1) contour.py

why can't I create Z by myself and have to use the given file? 
I can't create Z because tmerg and mchirp have different dimensions, why is that?

also, why can't I get a smooth appearance of the levels? only 4 shades of red are showing


2) contour_bis.py

same problem as always: I can't create a good logarithmic colorbar. If I add norm=LogNorm() it's just a mess, even
if I try and create logspaced bins
